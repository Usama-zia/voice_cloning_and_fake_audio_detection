# Voice Cloning and Fake Audio Detection
==============================

VCFAD - Voice Cloning and Fake Audio Detection

## Background:
We are a technology company working in the Cyber Security industry. Our focus is on building systems that ensure safe and secure digital presence by providing cutting-edge technologies. This project aims to create algorithms that can synthesize spoken audio by converting one speaker's voice to another's and to detect whether spoken audio is authentic or fake.

## Data Description:
There are two datasets utilized in this project, both publicly available:

### TIMIT Dataset:
The TIMIT corpus contains 6300 sentences spoken by 630 speakers from 8 major dialect regions of the United States. It is designed for acoustic-phonetic studies and the development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems.

### CommonVoice Dataset:
Common Voice is a corpus of speech data collected by Mozilla to help teach machines how real people speak. It is based on text from public domain sources and is used to train and test automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.

[Dataset Link](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets)

## Goals:
1. Build a voice cloning system that converts a speaker's spoken audio to another speaker's voice using the TIMIT dataset.
2. Develop a machine learning system to detect if spoken audio is natural or synthetically generated, using the CommonVoice dataset.

## Success Metrics:
- **Voice Cloning (VC)**: Use Word Error Rate (WER) for automatic evaluation of speech generation and report speaker classification accuracy.
- **Fake Audio Detection (FAD)**: Evaluate using F-score with positive labels from ground truth data and negative labels generated by the VC system.
